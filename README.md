# dotfiles

Nate Dillon’s dotfiles for macOS.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Xcode Command Line Tools Installation

For a fresh installation of macOS, run the following commands (if you already have Git installed you can skip this step).

```
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

**Note:** The `xcode-select --install` command appears to not work at the moment, giving an error saying the software is not currently available from the Software Update server. Unfortunately, the only fix I’ve found is to download the command line tools directly from the [Apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools), which requires a login.

#### Apple Account

You will need to sign in to your Apple account before running the installer to prevent the App Store software installation from failing.

### dotfiles Installation

Clone this repository to the directory of your choice (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/natedillon/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink), then run the `install.sh` script.

```
git clone git://github.com/natedillon/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## Usage

### Homebrew Bundle

> Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store and Whalebrew.

Bundle is used to install much of the software in the dotfiles. Currently installed software is dumped into the `Brewfile.dump` file:

```
brew bundle dump -f --file brewfiles/Brewfile.dump
```

More information can be found in the [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) GitHub repo.

### youtube-dl

> youtube-dl is a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites.

Basic usage:

```
youtube-dl [URL]
```

If default command doesn’t work for 1080p, make sure [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is installed and run this command:

```
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo+bestaudio/best' [URL]
```

Get an mp4 container and AAC audio with this command:

```
youtube-dl -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best' [URL]
```

For 4K video, you need to add `--prefer-avconv`:

```
youtube-dl [URL] --prefer-avconv
```


More information can be found on the [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) website.
